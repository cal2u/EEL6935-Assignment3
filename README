Genomics prediction task for EEL6935: Big Data Ecosystems

For the assignment, I tried using combinations of fully connected and recurrent layers, and I used a 10% dev partition to assess the model generalization.

The CNN and pytorch training code is based on https://github.com/Shawn1993/cnn-text-classification-pytorch. I modified the CNN to work on 1-Dimensional input, and I created a wrapper class to hide some of the training details.
